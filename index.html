        My name is James, and I am 13. One of my favorite hobbies is computer
        programming. I even built this website from scratch with my dad(I did
        most of it). I like computer programming so much, that I'm like to be a
        software engineer at Google like my dad. One of my other favorite
        hobbies is solving Rubik's cubes. My record on a 3x3 is 28 seconds.
        Other than that, one fun fact about me is that I have 5 younger
        siblings. You can check out my projects(including this website) on
